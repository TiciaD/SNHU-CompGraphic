# SNHU Computer Graphics and Visualization
## Project Overview/Analysis
This repo contains a project in which I had to create a 3D version of a 2D image of my selection using C++ and OpenGL. I learned a lot about what goes into rendering a 3-D object as well as how to design a project around rendering multiple objects efficiently. Unfortunately, due to time, I didn't have time to abstract as much of my code as I'd have liked but I tried to utilize making reusable functions especially for the shapes since those were repeated a lot. Same with using proper naming schemes and separating responsibilities between classes. I would've liked to have separated many of the shape functions to different files as well to keep the main file cleaner so that's something I will look to incorporate in future projects. In this class I was more focused on executing the basic functionality than trying to make my code cleaner and more reusable so there's a lot in this project that I would like to refactor eventually but I at least know what to keep in mind when I start new projects and how they can be cleaner than whatever project I've built previously.
